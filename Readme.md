# Description

The Web3 Builders Alliance trains aspiring lead and senior developers to serve projects across Web3. Juno Network funds the current 2 cohorts students are selected via an advanced, highly selective application process. For the upcoming cohort, there are close to 40 candidates signed up to participate. A partnership between the WBA and Flow creates immense potential to train developers to build the next wave of leading dApps in the Flow ecosystem.

The WBA model, a tremendous value added over traditional bootcamps, learning tutorials, and other commonly used self-directed learning approaches, developers complete factual and conceptual development asynchronously. In addition the class meets for three 90 minute live building sessions each week. These sessions maintain a minimum of a 5:1 student-to-teacher ratio and focus on building authentic projects that are relevant to the partner ecosystem. An example of a project that is in progress, developers learning at the institute funded by Juno are currently building twin test chains, and connecting them with IBC relayers.

The course is currently a 10 week session that culminates in a capstone project. These PoCs and MVPs projects are then reviewed by a panel of experts. That means that the course also directly contributes to the ecosystem with the capstone projects. In addition, during the duration of the program our cadets are also improving developer tooling, creating PR’s for code improvements, and working on documentation.  Upon graduation developers are awarded a non-transferable an NFT which is a WBA Certification. The metadata displays their work, skills, and interests. 

These NFT’s then become part of the WBA Developer Marketplace where projects can recruit and hire vetted professionals, while reviewing their portfolios that reflect work that was completed under the supervision of the WBA.  


## Problem statement
- The shortage of professional, vetted developers with a known quality of preparation continues to bottleneck the growth of Web3. Further, hiring an unqualified developer for a project can cost 30K or more, and the lost time of 1-2 months before discovering the poor hire. 
- There is a lack of professionalism, collaborative skill set, and focus on serving the public good amongst the community. 
- One of the many [articles](https://blockworks.co/theres-a-shortage-of-tech-and-female-crypto-talent-report/) describing the need for more talent in web3.


## Proposed solution

The Web3 Builders Alliance would like to offer an eight week long course to give developers deep knowledge about successfully building on Flow.  The course would inject a high -level of developer quality specifically trained to build on Flow, and Flow would have input on curriculum development, cadet projects, and capstone review during the course.

## Impact

- In what ways does this benefit the broader Flow developer ecosystem?
The one sure hedge in Web3 is to bet on great developers. This is what we will deliver. Expertise, collaborative-mindset, and professionalism injected into the Flow ecosystem, while also building public goods and developer tooling during the course will lift the Flow developer ecosystem. 

# Milestones and funding
The WBA proposes that we enter an agreement wherein we will run four quarterly sessions (2 cohorts each of 12-15 cadets).  Based on the below breakdown by quarter, Flow will grant the WBA $600K for a year of training developers.   This agreement will follow the below milestones, and be contingent upon Flow supporting the recruitment process by directing those who have completed the entry level training currently offered on Flow to the WBA institute. NOTE: The current per cohort fees are $150K per session.  We offer a significant discount for the commitment to the WBA.
